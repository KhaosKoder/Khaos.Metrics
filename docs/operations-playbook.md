# Operations PlaybookUse this guide when you deploy Khaos.Metrics and need to observe a live system.## Expose a snapshot endpoint1. Ensure `AddKhaosMetrics` is called during startup.2. Choose one of the opt-in surfaces:   - **Minimal API**: `app.MapMonitoringEndpoints("/monitoring");`   - **Controller**: derive from `MonitoringControllerBase` and expose your own `[HttpGet]` action that calls `GetSnapshotCore()`.3. Lock the route down (authn/z) because snapshots may contain sensitive operation names and tags.## Retrieve data- **Entire system**: `GET /monitoring/snapshot` returns `MonitoringSnapshot` with all operations.- **Single operation**: call `IMonitoringSnapshotProvider.GetOperationSnapshot("name")` from diagnostic tooling or add a specific endpoint.- **CPU percent**: look at `ProcessCpuPercent` inside `OperationCompletedContext` or expose the sampler history yourself.## Interpret snapshots- `Operations[i].CurrentRatePerSecond` â€“ average throughput over the hot window (`HotBucketCount Ã— HotBucketSeconds`).- `CurrentAverageDuration` / `CurrentMaxDuration` â€“ derived from recent hot buckets and translated back to `TimeSpan`.- `PerMinute` & `PerHour` â€“ time-series arrays already ordered from oldest â†’ newest; timestamps are aligned to the configured time mode.## Monitor event pressure- Drop counter: `MonitoringEngine.DroppedEvents` increases whenever the background queue is full and the dispatcher drops new events.- Mitigations:  1. Increase `EventQueueCapacity`.  2. Reduce `SamplingRate` (higher value = fewer events) or disable low-priority sinks.  3. Investigate sink latencyâ€”slow sinks should offload work asynchronously.## CPU sampling checklist1. Confirm `EnableCpuMeasurement = true` and redeploy.2. Allow one or two intervals (`CpuSampleIntervalSeconds`) before expecting non-null CPU values.3. Use the warm/cold windows to correlate CPU spikes with throughput changes.4. Turn sampling back off if you do not actively need the data.## Troubleshooting- **No metrics for a name**: verify you have not exceeded `MaxOperationCount`. New names are ignored when the cap is hit.- **Tags missing**: extra tags, or keys/values beyond configured limits, are trimmed silently per spec.- **Stale snapshots**: ensure your diagnostics job resolves `IMonitoringSnapshotProvider` from the same DI container used to register the engine (no static caches).- **High latency sinks**: switch to background queue mode (default) and rely on drops to protect callers.
