# Architecture OverviewThis document explains the moving pieces inside **Khaos.Metrics** so contributors know where logic lives and how data flows through the system.## Responsibilities at a Glance- **OperationMonitor** â€“ public entry point that instruments code paths and constructs `OperationScope` objects.- **MonitoringEngine** â€“ owns operation registries, background rotation timers, CPU sampling, and the event dispatcher.- **Metrics windows** â€“ hot/warm/cold circular buffers that aggregate counts, averages, and max values without unbounded memory growth.- **EventDispatcher** â€“ pushes `OperationCompletedContext` instances to sinks either inline or through a bounded background queue with drop tracking.- **MonitoringSnapshotProvider** â€“ composes immutable `MonitoringSnapshot`/`OperationSnapshot` instances for diagnostics endpoints.- **ProcessCpuSampler** â€“ optional background sampler that writes the latest process-level CPU% for inclusion in events.## Component Interactions1. **Instrumentation** â€“ Application code resolves `IOperationMonitor` and calls `Begin(name, tags)`. The monitor sanitizes tags, applies sampling, and records the start timestamp from the configured `ISystemClock`.2. **Metrics capture** â€“ When a scope is disposed, `OperationMetrics` updates counters, aggregates duration buckets, and returns the concurrency-at-end value.3. **Event routing** â€“ If sampling keeps the call, an `OperationCompletedContext` is built and sent to `MonitoringEngine.PublishEvent`, which defers to `EventDispatcher`.4. **Background maintenance** â€“ The engine rotates hot/warm/cold windows on its own timer thread and advances each registered `OperationMetrics` instance in lock-step.5. **Snapshot generation** â€“ `MonitoringSnapshotProvider` asks the engine for `OperationMetricsSnapshotData`, stitches per-operation stats, and stamps results with the `ISystemClock` according to the global time mode.## Event Dispatch Policies- `EventDispatchMode.Inline` invokes every sink on the callerâ€™s thread. Failures are swallowed to keep instrumentation safe.- `EventDispatchMode.BackgroundQueue` uses a bounded `Channel`. When the queue fills, the dispatcher explicitly drops the new event (matching `EventDropPolicy.DropNew`), increments the public `DroppedEvents` counter, and throttles log notifications. This ensures producers are never blocked by sinks.## Threading & Safety Considerations- `OperationMetrics` relies on `Interlocked` operations so increments can happen concurrently without locks.- Ring buffers are allocated once and reused; advancing a window resets the next slot instead of allocating a new container.- `MonitoringEngine` serializes operation creation behind a single lock to enforce the `MaxOperationCount` limit while keeping steady-state reads lock-free.- `MonitoringSnapshotProvider` only constructs immutable POCOs, so consumers can cache or serialize results without additional synchronization.## Extension Points- **Event sinks** â€“ Implement `IOperationEventSink` and register it in DI to observe slow/hot operations.- **ASP.NET opt-in** â€“ `MonitoringControllerBase` and `MapMonitoringEndpoints` expose snapshots only when explicitly wired up.- **Future drop policies** â€“ The dispatcher centralizes drop decisions, making it straightforward to add modes like â€œdrop oldestâ€ without touching call sites.
